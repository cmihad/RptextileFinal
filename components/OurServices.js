        Merchandisers help create a key connection between the buyer and the producer. From the pre-production activities, such as price settlement, order placement, and sample approval, to the post-production activities, such as, and confirming that the goods have been handed over to the shipping line on time, merchandisers are involved in every step of the process.

With this in mind, we have a dedicated merchandising team for each of our customers. This way, our customers are sure to receive excellent service in communication, development, sampling, regular production updates, and shipping confirmation. In addition to that, having a dedicated team that will closely monitor the process will help in identifying problems and take proactive steps.
