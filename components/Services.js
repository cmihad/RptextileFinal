              The sustenance and growth of the textile industry and by extension the fashion industry depends greatly in the process of product development. Product development is the very first stage of introduction of new style. The concept of new style or design is developed by fashion designer which is merely a design or sketch on the paper. Product development is the process where that sketch or design is converted in to a 3D form garment, with all technical and aesthetic approach keeping in mind. Our design team reflects the thoughts of designer in physical sample.
